#+STARTUP: showall
* Register formatters for other types. Eg. Graph match results, symbol table
*** Debug output for SymbolTable, LookupExpression. 
*** REPL to call display function that gets registered display method

* Make parse tree conversion able to handle direct list children:
**  pass parent down and connect children to it instead of pass child up - handle lists
* 

* Later: Formatter
** How not to indent for each car/cdr term
** Save indent position on stack and restore indent level
** Indent for ( is 1
** Insert newlines based on available space
*** If token does not fit, find last previous token of that depth with something before it
**** Insert line before
**** Indent if previous indent was lower - need stack to restore
**** Recheck spacing going forward from there
**** Adjust space count for spacing
*** When setting newline before, reset current line position, adjust indent
** Check for unbalanced indents


** Pass in flag for max length: Cutoff long lists, incoming edges.
*** Fn to call for full output in command window
** Make it easy to invoke a codegen from command window. Which one? Register a list that can check if that vertex is one that each codegen knows how to do.

* 
* More tests for grammar rules: 
** Check that all punctuation is skipped (keep comments in case add back for tokens)
** Other kinds of tokens: number, comments

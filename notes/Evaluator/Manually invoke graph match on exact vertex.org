#+STARTUP: showall
* How to refer to specific node: an expression to navigate edges to find it
* Path expression: Just need a list of edgedef names and index numbers. Lookup by id number.
** Syntax for expression: sequence of edgedefs, index numbers
*** Syntax for building common graph shapes
*** Default edgedef for connecting items in a series, syntax can override
*** Define path fragments so they can be reused. 
*** Invoke function that returns next vertex. 
*** Parameterized. Using literal and other expressions, allow reference to vertices on preceeding edges.
* Bind specific vertices (not just one)
** Define new syntax for pairing. Similar to how pairing is reported.
** Modify algorithm to take in pairing from graph input. 
** Modify algorithm to take input from graph, probably need to modify converter
* Display matches in format that depends on content

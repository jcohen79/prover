**** Is dual to skolemization
**** Preserves validility (true for all interpretation)skolemization preserves satisfiability (there is an interpretation that makes formula true)

** Since the 1980s, type theory has been a popular choice for the logical basis of computer theorem proving systems. hol [24], imps [20], Isabelle [46], ProofPower [40], pvs [45], and tps are examples of systems based on versions of Church’s type theory, and Agda [11], Automath [44], Coq [10], lego [48], and Nuprl [9] are examples of systems based on constructive type theories.

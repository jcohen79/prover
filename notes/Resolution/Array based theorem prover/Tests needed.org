#+STARTUP: showall

* Test for ascFilter:
* Test full version of equate (with fUnify)
* Test cases:
** Change Lsm default to be constant: Or set parm on parser.
*** Define a fn to mark objects as constant.
** equate
*** Check recovery from push
*** Mismatch in different argument positions, 
*** Singleton cases for L and S: 
**** Pred, fn, vbls, consts
*** Occurs across multiple vars, back and forth
** Compare run time for large test cases
*** Larger proofs, using equality

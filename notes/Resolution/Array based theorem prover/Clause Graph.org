#+STARTUP: showall
* does not appear to be having this problem yet with semantic resolution'
** May occur again when adding structure that involves someone independent subparts

** Idea is to factorize the process where two terms of clause each create chain reaction.
** Would like to find path of resolutions that cancel out the terms added when resolving against the remaining terms of  a clause.
*** That would result in dynamic programming approach, leading to null clause.,
*** Problem: terms that would lead to empty have not been created yet. Seems like backward search is same as forward.
** Would work well for subsumption
** Create a static graph of initial terms, then add on for factors?
** Is related to axiom schema? At clause level, axiom schema is term level

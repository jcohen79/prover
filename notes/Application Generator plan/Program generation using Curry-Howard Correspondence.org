* Aka "formulae-as-types correspondence"



* See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curry%E2%80%93Howard_correspondence


** Outline
*** Goal is to find program that means required description
*** CHI says that type of program is equiv to an assertion, and  a program (function) of that type is equivalent to a proof of that assertion
*** Describe type of function very precisely using first order logic
*** Convert to combinators
*** Use prover to create the proof
*** Convert resolution proof to proof using rules required by CHI
*** That is the required program


* https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homotopy_type_theory
** "allows mathematical proofs to be translated into a computer programming language for computer proof assistants much more easily than before."

* Issue: how to convert resolution proof to natural deductive proof?
** 1971: http://ai.stanford.edu/~nilsson/OnlinePubs-Nils/PublishedPapers/resolution.pdf
*** Extracting Information from Resolution Proof Trees'
*** Is more general than the answer predicate

** Can the cuts be rearranged to follow needed inference rules, and have final clause be the desired formula?

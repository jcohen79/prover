#+STARTUP: showall
* http://www.swi-prolog.org/download/stable

* Created C:\Program Files\swipl\specs\contrast.pl

* Issues:
** Cumbersome to maintain list of mutually exclusive states. Parts would be too if there were more.
** Maybe could use API to access info from Specs.cs 
** Does not discover incompletess
** How to understand inconsistency? Manually debug?
** That examples probably could be done in SQL. What value does a more complex data structure built using prolog provide? Could do completeness and consistency of info in a way that is separate from actual execution.

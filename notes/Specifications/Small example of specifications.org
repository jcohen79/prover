#+STARTUP: showall
* A simple intentional application

* Demonstrate that the concept works and can produce useful information

** Gather entities, properties, commands
** Define base predicates for framework
*** Time
*** Command, execution
*** Property, get/set property
*** Create/delete object
** Write example commands, gestures


* Minimal app
** One parent, has children, one property on each.
** Add/remove child
** Set prop on parent and child

* How to check correctness of framework?
** What assertions about it?
*** Liveness
*** Show sequence of commands
**** How?
***** Make assertions to specify a give state of the app
***** Use deduction to find what are
******  the valid commands
****** The steps that will have for the command



* HelloD?


* Represent
** Simple set of classes, attributes, relationships
** Primitive commands on document
** Features
** Commands
*** Pre/post-conditions
** Invariants that hold between commands
*** Automatic actions that need to happen: e.g. closing a menu or floatie

* Goal:
** Simple test of each spec language feature and related software
** Create combined specs where feature overlap and create exceptions
** Find inconsistencies
** Incompleteness
*** Terms that have no definition
*** Legal states that cannot be attained by the available commands
** Generate model code
** Generate app code

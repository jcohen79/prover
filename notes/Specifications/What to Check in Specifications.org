** Incompleteness
*** (Express as rules that should be run on the rules themselves)
*** Terms that have no definition
**** What is defined enough? Each lack will mean some operations are not possible. Sometimes symbolic evaluation is enough
*** For each each property
**** Check value is defined by a command or rule for all possible states.
**** In intersection: value is the same (e.g. >= vs <=)
**** How to check that union of conditions is all that is possible?
***** Satisfaction: Re-write rules, paramodulation
***** Prove that negation of meeting conditions and invariant is contradiction
*** For each Command
**** Check behavior is defined in all states that it is enabled for
***** Ways to prove:
****** Being member of support implies member of required
****** Conditions for support imply conditions of required
****** Contraction if element in required in not element (meets condition) of required
*** Invariants between commands

** Inconsistency
*** Check all places where the rules set the same property. Check that two such rules cannot be run in the same state, or they result in the same value
**** Makes rule execution to be deterministic in the sense that order doesn't matter. 
*** Check that commands do not set a property that is also set by a rule, unless there is a rule to map that change back to where the property value is derived from.
*** Properties
**** Rule results satisfy invariants
*** Commands
**** Post conditions satisfy invariants
**** Pre-conditions are satisfied by invariants
*** Invariants
**** Each command post condition satisfies global invariants

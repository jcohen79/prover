#+STARTUP: showall
** Understand how axioms need to be structured so the correspond to code (see specification detail page)
** Try out a resolution prover using Coq
** First demo simple code generation
*** Show that code corresponding to proof makes sense
*** Simple example, without paramodulation
** Write axioms - specs: commands, required output state
** Write assertion to prove - there exists a sequence of commands with required output state
** Relate to code:
*** Associate method with each axiom. Type of method fits type of axiom
*** Compose the methods using de Nivelle formula
**** https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/d86c/36c131ebf936f1f977a2a690ea5381a37aca.pdf
*** Invoke method on initial state
*** Write out result as term
*** Convert term to code
*** Run code

* Issues
** Formulate code for axioms according to type of axioms
** What is input to combined function?

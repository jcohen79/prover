Knowledge Map

 short term
	 how to make diagram update slowly?
	     compute motion quickly, then user linear interpolation to final position
		 don't start from overate, use old values, update old nodes instead of
			 creating new
		define a service to build diagrams, diagrams stored in mongo
		   user can have a list of diagrams they ar working one, define with entities/relationships/attrs
		   operations cause server to update a diagram, send changes to client
		   

 exploratory graph
  make it touch oriented: click on node to show possible extensions
  
  client makes request, process updates in response
   server builds  diagram in DB, send client a diagram update json command
   
  operations:
     extend graph, trim graph
	
  	
   
 Application Modernization
	 search db from ingestion
	  generate diagram
	  relationship to workbench:
	         use the pipe to generate the json svg data to the client
			 configure mapping of data structure to diagram/ Ul components
				replace clumsy	attempts at DSLs in TS with real language,
					 can view logic of Ul in multiple views
			  WYSIWYG on sample data
			 relations to whiteboard:
				 having projection on desktop allows richer graphic ul
				  show diagram of flow between pipe local vs remote
